Project Description 

We named our project " Behind The Scenes" to create a 360 photo of the auditorium to show people how it looks behind the curtains when they're closed. We hope to that this behind the scenes encourage younge people to get into programs in school so they can proform on stage and rehearse. The purpose is to have you to see what it is like without all of the show projects on stage.
